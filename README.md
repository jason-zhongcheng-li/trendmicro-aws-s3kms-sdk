## Description

In this round of Trend Microâ€™s hiring process. Trend Micro would like to assess candidates' technical skills with an exercise that should take a few hours. Trend Micro wants to be respectful to your time and an exercise can save multiple interviews.

## Installation
Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the dependencies in the project.

```bash
npm install
```
> Note: The Mocha library have to stick on version 6.x.x otherwise you will be hitting 'No test files found' error. I have no time to figure it out against latest version.

## Configuration
Some of the functions in this project need to talk to AWS S3 and KMS services. You are supposed to set up a local configuration of AWS credentials

1. Create a *.env* file at the root directory of the application and add the variables to it.
2. Variables
```
ACCESS_KEY_ID=
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
BUCKET=
KEY_ID=
REGION=
MAX_KEYS=2
```
>Note: No space and No punctuation

## Unit/Function tests
Use npm scripts set in the package.json file to execute unit and function tests.
```bash
npm run coverage
```
## Code Coverage
As a result of execute unit/function tests as above, there will be two folders (*.nyc_output* and *coverage*) automatically created at the root of the application.
Go to *coverage* folder and open *index.html* file with browser, you can view the report of code coverage.

# Problem to solve

## Backend Project:
AWS S3 + KMS

## Requirements:

1. [X] Create a Node.js library to download all objects in a given S3 bucket and save them locally, maintaining directory structure.
2. [X] Control concurrency to keep at most four parallel downloads in progress.
*Hint: You can use Bluebird promise library.*
>Note: I'm not using Bluebird to promisify the functions. Bluebird is a promise implementation of JavaScript, especially for call-back function in old JavaScript.
Now a days, modern JS (ES6 and later versions) has improved a lot of syntax and features. Every new release of ES intruduces new powerful features of Promise, Async and so on. I dont think it's a good practise to use the third party lib on top of new JavaScript. It makes project hard to debug and handover to those junior developers, unless we have to use promise features in old IE browser.
3. [X] Create a file containing the list of downloaded files then encrypt this file using KMS with a user-defined CMK and save it locally.
4. [X] Write unit tests for your code by mocking AWS S3 API.
Hint: You can use the aws-sdk-mock npm module
>Note: At my company, we are using Mocha to unit test AWS API and it works as we expected. I read tech doc of *aws-sdk-mock* which is quite similar to what Mocha does.
I did not deep dive *aws-sdk-mock* in this interview stage but I will be exploring further if this aws module is powerful over Mocha.
5. [X] Produce a code coverage report for your test suite.
6. [X] Write an integration test to demonstrate full functionality of code.
